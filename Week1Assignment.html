                Module Text description on support.liverpool-online.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>Module presents an overview of many aspects of Computer Science (CS) 
           and links them together into a coherent whole. Many of the topics 
           covered also act as an introduction to the various subjects that 
           make up the other Modules offered by Laureate. 
           The Module begins with an introduction to participating in a global 
           classroom as well as the history of computing. From there, the topic 
           changes to the social impact of computing on society. Next a 
           description of the basic facilities provided by the machine hardware 
           is covered; elements of assembly language programming and the 
           facilities provided by the operating system and networks are discussed. 
           Software, algorithms and the properties of high-level languages are 
           considered in some detail leading to their amalgamation in the 
           discipline of software engineering, before data types and methods 
           for the design of algorithms are introduced. Following an exposition 
           of databases, the Module closes with a discussion about issues 
           in current research in IT.</p>
